This report summarizes my work during the first official GSoC coding week (June 1â€“7). The main focus was setting up the DBpedia Extraction Framework locally and initiating server access coordination with my university.

## Tasks Completed

- Set up a local server and tested the DBpedia Extraction Framework.
- Identified and resolved compatibility issues with Java 8 and Maven.
- Held a second mentor meeting on June 4 to discuss project and server status.
- Received and completed two server access request forms (University of Hamburg) provided by my mentor.
- Participated in a meeting with the DBpedia team and mentors on June 6, where I introduced myself and shared my project objective.
- Received initial server access credentials from mentors.
- Communicated and followed up with Addis Ababa University (Ethiopia) ICT to explore the possibility of using a their server as a backup option.

## Challenges

- DBpedia Extraction Framework required Java 8, which caused compatibility issues.
- Maven errors during the build process were hard to diagnose, but I resolved them by finding compatible versions and reconfiguring the environment.

## Next Steps

- Install and test the DBpedia Extraction Framework on the **main server**.
- Configure the **AAU server as a backup** environment.

## Conclusion

Week 1 was a mix of technical setup and administrative coordination. It was satisfying to resolve initial build issues and to see progress on gaining access to the university server. I'm now set up to begin framework deployment and data extraction in the next phase.

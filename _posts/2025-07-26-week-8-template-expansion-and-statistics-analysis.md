This post summarizes the progress made during the eighth GSoC coding week (July 20 – July 26). This week focused on significantly expanding template mappings, testing cross-language statistics generation, and documenting the DBpedia pipeline for future contributors.

## Tasks Completed

- Added **15 new template mappings** for Amharic Wikipedia:
  - `Philosopher`, `Lake`, `Mayor`, `Continent`, `Bank`, `BusinessPerson`, `Disease`, `Comedian`, `University`, `Hospital`, `Hotel`, `Mosque`, `Church`, `NationalAnthem`
  - These mappings follow the DBpedia ontology and were aligned to match existing data structures in the Amharic Wikipedia where possible.

- **Tested mapping statistics generation** using other languages including Romanian and Irish.
  - Unfortunately, both returned **zero mapped templates**, indicating that the issue might not be language-specific but possibly related to content availability or dump configuration.

- Good news: **statistics generation worked for older templates** that already had corresponding infobox usage in Amharic Wikipedia.
  - This confirms the pipeline is functional when templates are properly implemented in articles.
  - Further investigation is needed to verify how updates to dumps and templates are reflected in the statistics.

- Continued refining the **technical documentation**:
  - Steps to configure the DBpedia Extraction Framework.
  - Creating and mapping templates.
  - Running local statistics generation.
  - This document aims to provide a clear on-ramp for new contributors to the Amharic DBpedia project.

- Participated in the **Week 7 mentor meeting** on **July 25, 2025**.
  - Presented this week’s progress and challenges.
  - Mentors emphasized the importance of analyzing current mapping statistics and preparing a report to evaluate overall template coverage.

- Published the **Week 7 blog post** to the GitHub Pages project blog.

## Challenges

- Statistics for newer mappings are not yet reflecting in updated dumps, requiring deeper investigation into dump refresh frequency and integration timing.
- Mapping analysis across multiple languages still returns inconsistent results.

## Next Steps

- Further **analyze the mapping statistics** to understand coverage and limitations.
- Continue **live DBpedia extraction** and observe how recent mappings affect RDF output.
- Prepare an **analytical report** summarizing the current state of mapped templates and their usage in Amharic Wikipedia.

## Conclusion

This week brought a significant expansion in Amharic DBpedia’s template coverage. While challenges persist in reliably generating up-to-date mapping statistics, successful outputs from older templates confirm that the core pipeline works. Going forward, focused analysis and continued iteration will help surface gaps and validate mapping impact across Wikipedia articles and RDF outputs.

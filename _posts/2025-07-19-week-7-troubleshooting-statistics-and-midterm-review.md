This post summarizes the progress made during the seventh GSoC coding week (July 13 – July 19). The focus this week was on expanding DBpedia mappings, attempting local statistics generation, and completing the GSoC midterm evaluation process.

## Tasks Completed

- This week marked the **GSoC Midterm Evaluation** period. I was expected to evaluate my mentors via the official platform, but the mentor evaluation form was not available on my dashboard.  
  - I contacted the **GSoC support team**, and they responded promptly with guidance.
  - After resolving the issue, I successfully submitted my mentor evaluation.

- Added **three new template mappings** for Amharic Wikipedia:
  - `Ambassador`, `Bridge`, and `President`
  - These were mapped using the standard DBpedia `TemplateMapping` structure, and relevant properties were aligned with the ontology.

- Worked extensively on **generating local mapping statistics**:
  - Followed the updated steps provided by the DBpedia team for setting up and executing the statistics generation process.
  - Despite trying different configurations — including changes to mappings, dump files, extractor settings, and environment parameters — the process remained unsuccessful and returned no output.
  - Reached out to a fellow DBpedia contributor working on the Hindi chapter. We exchanged setup details, but encountered similar results on both sides.

- Drafted a **documentation guide** outlining:
  - How to set up the DBpedia Extraction Framework.
  - How to create templates and mappings.
  - Steps to generate local statistics.
  - This draft will be refined and published as part of the knowledge base for future contributors.

- Held a **mentor meeting** to review the issues around statistics generation.
  - We confirmed that the steps being followed were correct.
  - My mentor will further explore the problem in the coming days to identify any hidden issues or configuration gaps.

- Published the **Week 6 blog post** to the GitHub Pages project blog.

## Challenges

- Local **Amharic mapping statistics generation** continues to return no results, despite multiple configuration attempts and community input.
- Some newly mapped templates may not yet be used in Wikipedia content, which limits testing and RDF validation.

## Next Steps

- Continue adding **new infobox templates** and **complete mappings** for those with sufficient properties.
- Revisit the **statistics generation** pipeline, experimenting with different DBpedia components and possibly testing with other languages as a baseline.
- Resume and advance the **DBpedia Live extraction** process for Amharic.
- Finalize and publish the documentation for template/mapping/statistics setup.

## Conclusion

Although local statistics generation remains a challenge, this week saw meaningful progress in terms of midterm evaluation, new template mappings, and cross-contributor collaboration. With new mappings added and documentation underway, the Amharic DBpedia project is steadily moving forward. The focus in the coming weeks will be on improving tooling, increasing infobox coverage in Wikipedia, and resuming RDF extraction efforts.
